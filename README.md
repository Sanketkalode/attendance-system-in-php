# attendance-system-in-php
A small php project to automate the tedious task of taking attendance in colleges and make this task easier.


You need database connectivity and a default database with following tables

1.faculty(varchar uname,varchar pass,varchar fullname)
2.subjects(int id,varchar subname,varchar subject_name,varchar uname)
3.sub_stud(varchar <subnames>) i.e. with all the column names are used to store the subnames and rows to store students registered to      that specific subject.


note:Rest of the tables are automatically created.
